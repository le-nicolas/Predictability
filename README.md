# Predictability
Predictability bridges the gap between the theoretical knowledge and practical application. By ensure that tools and models behave consistently as expected, predictability makes them actionable. Design reliable systems, make informed decisions, solve complex problems.

# Actionable cycle

1. modeling: predictive framework is developed, such as F = ma for mechanics or machine learning algo for data classification.

2. Application: Framework is tested in real-world scenarios.

3. Validation: Predictions are compared to actual outcomes, if the predictions holds, confidence in the "tool" grows,

4. Refinement: Discrepencies lead to improvements, making the tool even more robust.

Transition from observation to theory or vice versa, We sought to generalize and predict behaviors of system.
